# ContributorRepo-Quickstart
The ContributorRepo-Quickstart is used to build repositories for contributors to the ModernApps Ninja community.

The repo provides a structured environment to save assignments and records of completion for ModernApps.ninja courses and other contributions made to or in affiliation with ModernApps Ninja repositories. 

The docs/ folder in this repository is pre-configured to provide a [Contributor Portfolio website](https://kampfires.github.io/ContributorRepo-Quickstart/) for github pages, to organize and present the accomplishments that contributors achieve in the ModernApps Ninja Community. 

Please edit the `./docs/_config.yml` and the `/.docs/index.md` files to customize your portfolio website. 

Participating ModernApps.ninja courses provide instructions to create a directory for the course, and the specific format required to post your course assignments in to recieve recognition. For additional details, please follow the instructions provided in each participating ModernApps.ninja course.
